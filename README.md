# EEG Schizophrenia Detection

This repository contains the code for a project on Schizophrenia Detection using EEG data. The goal is to analyze EEG data and develop a model for detecting schizophrenia based on the provided datasets.

**Import Note:** The majority of the logic, preprocessing, and analysis are implemented in the `util` module. Refer to the `util` module for detailed functions and processing steps.

## Data
Code in this repository assumes that all data is locally downloaded and unzipped into a `dataset` folder. The `dataset` folder should include directories for each of the 81 subjects' data.
